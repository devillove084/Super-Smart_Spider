# Super-Smart_Spider

This is not a  spider,this is a smart spider!!!

## test is a new tech for this project.
* I will use http2.0 protocol for this spider project, not only for web front-end development ,but also for hole project;
* I will use Python & NodeJs & Shell language for integrated development;

NodeJs is a main program for hole framework,Python for collecting data and calculating,awk and sed perhaps for arrangement,maybe c&c++ or go language will appear in my project.
